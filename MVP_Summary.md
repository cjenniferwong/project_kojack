#MVP Summary:
A one page document, describing the minimum viable product. This should include the following sections:

For my project 5, I would like to explore social relationships by conducting a social network analysis on SoundCloud. To retrieve the necessary data, I hope to start seed with my own profile, and from there I want to get as many different profiles as possible. I will get my followers, and who I'm following, and from that list I will continue to find new users, and so on and so forth.

After researching, I will have to hack my way through SoundCloud as their API is not available. Currently, they are not allowing people to register new apps, which would have been required to get the necessary credentials to make API requests. Sad.

So, that means I have to scrape.

After I get my data, I hope to make predictions/recommendations on:
1. Which users to follower
2. What songs should you listen to


#Domain:
A brief description of the domain you're working in, and a discussion of your familiarity with this domain
The domain is network analysis and music, two of which I have spent too much time exploring and thinking about. Two of my greatest passions is understanding social relationships and how to make better recommendations. It was a nice-to-have to have my project about music, and I was able to do so.

I am also very familiar with API and SoundCloud (not necessarily Soundcloud's API). I am also not very familiar with the implementation of social network analysis, so this will be new to me. Regardless, I am very excited, and hope to complete a project that is representative of all that I've learned so far, as well as showcase my potential, like a capstone lol.

That said, I would greatly appreciate any guidance or suggestions that you may have. Because I am getting my own data, I don't necessarily know what to get since this is my very first social network analysis. What I will be doing so getting a dataset that was used to ask a similar question, and trying to identify what was critical to answering their question so that I can try to find the necessary equivalent features for my project.

Additionally, I would like some input into what can be added to round-out my project. What are some techniques that you would like to see from my project? My only main objectives is to do some sort of recommendation (because this is the area that I'm most interested in working in after bootcamp), and maybe neural networks because it's cool and I didnt use it for any of my projects so far.

I would have liked to grab the song from the interwebs and try to make recommendations based on the song itself, but i'm not sure how difficult that is. Just an idea.

Data: A table with variables name and variable type fields, listing the variables you'd like to utilize


Known unknowns: A list of items with an unclear level of effort, or which will require special attention
