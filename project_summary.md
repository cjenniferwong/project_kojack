I wonder if you can have multiple instances on aws scraping (to utilize the different IP addresses) so that I can maximize the rate of data I can get for my project. I'd rather have most of my data at the start of my project. OH! Vivien did something similar to this for her last project so I should see if she can help me with that.

Dear Diary, 
It's been a while since I've written in you. I just released my scraper into the world seeded it with Sarah Jake's follower (notatyourparty).
Next Steps would be to release a similar notebook but with a different seed. Someone who is in a different music genre.

Here is the running list of seeds.
1. 477797010



Afterwards, I need to get the tracks and likes from each person in my database. Omg.

Note to self:
I should probably get a list of all the users who I've gotten the likes and streams of and put that in a set.
The put the followers and following users in a set
take the difference
and use that as my queue!
